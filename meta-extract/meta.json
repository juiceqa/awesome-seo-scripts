The average injected activity was188.7 ± 40.7 MBq(5.1 ± 1.1 mCi). No serious adverse reactions were attributed to gallium Ga 68 gozetotide. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness, occurring at a rate of &lt; 1%.Please see additional Important Safety Information below.Please see fullPrescribing Information.AccessibilityWell-established and reliable national distribution network68Ga is a widely accessible radioisotope for PSMA PET imaging68Ga is a widely available radioisotope that can be accessed through a nationwide distribution network of generators and cyclotrons, including those within major academic centers and community health systems.68Ga extends the reach of PSMA imaging to enable people throughout the United States to benefit from this important technology.568Ga delivers the flexibility of either high-volume production (via cyclotrons) or on-site, on-demand production (via generators) that may enhance the efficiency of day-to-day workflow4,5Ability to fill STAT orders and accommodate patient schedule changes4Flexibility to image patients throughout the day, even on short notice4Well-established distribution network for an efficient administrative and purchasing process5"
